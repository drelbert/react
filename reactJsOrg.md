# Rendering Elements 
    smallest building block of React app 
      react elements = plain objects 
      as opposed to 
      DOM elements 

# Components and Props
 
    components allow for splitting UI into 
        independant
        reuseable 
            pieces 

        are like JavaScript functions
            they accept arbitrary inputs(props)
            and return react elements 
            to describe the UI
    
    function and class components 
        to define a component
        write a function 

    props = properties object argument with data 
    returning a react element

    these compononets = function components 
    since they are just JavaScript functions
